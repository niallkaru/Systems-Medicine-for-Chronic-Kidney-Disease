## For 20-credit MPhys Project for Physics with a Year Abroad, Niall Karunaratne 2024-25
Repository for my MPhys projecting focussing upon the modelling of fibrosis and cellular senescence within murine kidneys.
### Completed so far
- Setting up GitHub
- Basic structure for senescence and fibrosis
### Planned
- Check the results obtained are what is expected, if not correct code
- Edit code for all the equations used in paper for fibrosis (currently just four are modelled)
- Dabble in some stochastic modelling
